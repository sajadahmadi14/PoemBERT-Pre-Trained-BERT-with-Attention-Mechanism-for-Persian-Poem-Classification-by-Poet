PoetRecognizer: An NLP-based Approach to Recognize Poet's Style in Persian Poetry with Pre-Trained BERT model and Attention Mechanism.


pre-trained BERT models and attention mechanism to classify the poets of Persian poems. Here are the steps involved:

First, pre-trained BERT models are used as a starting point for building attention-based models. These models are trained on Persian poems from 10 different poets.
The attention mechanism is used to focus on specific parts of the poem text during classification, allowing the model to pick up on subtle linguistic differences between the poets.
A context classifier is then used to identify the poet associated with each poem.
The training and evaluation process is done using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Finally, the trained models are tested on new poems to evaluate their generalization capabilities.

By using pre-trained BERT models and attention mechanism, this GitHub repository provides a powerful tool for recognizing the poet of each Persian poem. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on specific parts of each poem's text, helping it to recognize subtle linguistic patterns unique to each poet. This results in an accurate and efficient classification model.

The use of standard metrics for evaluating the model's performance ensures that the model is robust and reliable. Additionally, the testing of the trained models on new poems demonstrates their ability to generalize beyond the training dataset.
